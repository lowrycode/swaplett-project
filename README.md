# Swaplett

Swaplett is a word puzzle game where players complete a grid of words by swapping letters into their correct positions. Letters can be moved by dragging them with a mouse or finger on touch-screen devices.

It uses two third-party APIs:
- <a href="https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**Random Word API**</a> - to fetch a specified number of random words with the correct word length
- <a href="https://dictionaryapi.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**Free Dictionary API**</a> - to fetch information about the words such as meanings and links to pronounciation audio clips

You can visit the deployed website <a href="https://lowrycode.github.io/swaplett-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">**here**</a>.

# Project Planning

The [**Project Planning**](project_planning.md) document outlines my personal goals for the project as well as the pseudo code for the JavaScript functionality.
